elmtris
=======

A Tetris game for the web browser written in Elm

A working example of the game is (or was) on my directory page here: [http://people.cs.umass.edu/~jcollard/elmtris/](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~jcollard/elmtris/)

A Makefile is provided for GNU/Linux which shows how you might deploy Elm Tetris.
